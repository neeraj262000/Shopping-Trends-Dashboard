Shopping Trends Analysis 🛍️
🚀 Just wrapped up a comprehensive Tableau Dashboard titled "Shopping Trends Analysis"!

As part of a real-world data storytelling initiative, I explored detailed shopping behavior data to reveal patterns in product preferences, seasonal trends, and customer spending habits — with the goal of helping retailers and analysts optimize strategy and stock planning.
